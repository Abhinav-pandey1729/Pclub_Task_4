# Pclub_Task_4
My solution to the PS of NLP task.

I first started out by importing all the libraries where I was getting an environment issue between anaconda venv and on my system so I opened a VS Code file through anaconda navigator and then worked in that.

Throughout the coding preocess, when I wanted to run the file, I opened it Google Collab but I got an error IOPub data rate exceeded so I came back to VS Code and Ran the file and then it was running.

I had some difficulties while running the file because I was always getting the output as there are less than % paragraphs but when I introduced the top_indices parameter and used argsort it worked out well for me. I was also getting Value Errors and Key Error 2 which made me realise that I had not dropped the duplicate values in the file.


I have attached my submission as a zip file which has to be run in the same folder as the xlsx files otherwise it will not run correctly. I haven't been able to attach a screenshot fo my model because it says these files cannot be uploaded but I have shown a sample query in the pynb itself.
